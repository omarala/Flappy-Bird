# Flappy-Bird
Simple remake of "Flappy Bird" game in c++ using SFML Library.   
Feel free to play, see the code and suggest improvements.     
Note that you can't quit the game while in Pause or Game Over mode.    
This is also my first c++ project, be indulgent.     

## To compile    
You need a SFML version>=2.04.    
To install it:   
`sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`   
Simply type in a linux terminal:    
`make`
